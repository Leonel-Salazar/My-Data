    "text": "Group Ten is conducting a comprehensive analysis of historical data from various public agencies to evaluate the impact of Varroa mites, American Foulbrood, and global warming on hive losses in the United States.This research utilizes extensive datasets from the National Agricultural Statistics Service, the Agricultural Statistics Board, and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), encompassing multiple years of data. The data highlights the topic on hive losses attributed to mites, bacterial infections, and environmental factors related to global warming. Through advanced data visualization techniques in R, we aim to demonstrate and validate the detrimental effects of these factors on honeybee colonies, highlighting the consequent implications for honey production and broader food security. Dennis and Kemp’s study on honey bee hive collapse [@hivecollapse] provides important insights into Allee effects and ecological resilience."

Given the importance of bee colonies in agriculture, it was logical to source data from the following two authoritative websites: 1. USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS): This site provides comprehensive agricultural data, including statistics on honey production and colony health. 2. Bee Informed Partnership: This site offers detailed insights and research on bee colony management and health, contributing valuable information on the status and trends of bee populations.

These plots suggest that while losses are a consistent issue, their magnitude and causes can vary widely, pointing to the need for tailored strategies to address colony health.\n\nThese visualizations collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by bee colonies, from composition and health to external threats like Varroa mites and seasonal variations in losses.\n\n\nVARROA MITE EXPOSED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVARROA MITE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(reshape2)\n\nWarning: package 'reshape2' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'reshape2'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    smiths\n\nlibrary(cluster)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'cluster'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:maps':\n\n    votes.repub\n\nlibrary(car)\n\nLoading required package: carData\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'car'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:purrr':\n\n    some\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    recode\n\nlibrary(factoextra)\n\nWarning: package 'factoextra' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\nWelcome!
