    "text": "Group Ten is conducting a comprehensive analysis of historical data from various public agencies to evaluate the impact of Varroa mites, American Foulbrood, and global warming on hive losses in the United States.This research utilizes extensive datasets from the National Agricultural Statistics Service, the Agricultural Statistics Board, and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), encompassing multiple years of data. The data highlights the topic on hive losses attributed to mites, bacterial infections, and environmental factors related to global warming. Through advanced data visualization techniques in R, we aim to demonstrate and validate the detrimental effects of these factors on honeybee colonies, highlighting the consequent implications for honey production and broader food security. Dennis and Kemp’s study on honey bee hive collapse (Dennis & Kemp, 2016) provides important insights into Allee effects and ecological resilience. Warmer climate may impact bees(2024warmer?)"

A few key observations can be made from the data:\nCentral Tendency and Spread: - The median values for both types of losses (represented by the central line in each box) are relatively low across all years, indicating that the majority of losses are concentrated towards the lower end of the scale.\nYearly Comparison: - For the year 2015, the losses due to Colony Collapse Disorder and Deadout are higher compared to the subsequent years. This can be observed from the height of the boxes and the spread of the data points. - There is a noticeable decrease in the losses for both categories in 2016 and 2017. The boxes for these years are smaller and closer to the x-axis, indicating lower values.\nOutliers: - There are significant outliers present in all years for both types of losses. These outliers indicate that while most of the data points are clustered around the lower values, there are instances of very high losses that deviate from the norm.\nComparison between Loss Types: - The distribution of “LOSS, DEADOUT” appears to have more variability compared to “LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER”, particularly in 2015 and 2016. This is indicated by the wider interquartile ranges and more spread out data points.\nOverall Trends: - Overall, the boxplot suggests a decline in both types of losses from 2015 to 2017. However, the presence of outliers in each year indicates that there are still occasional severe loss events.\nThis highlights the trends and variations in honeybee colony losses due to Colony Collapse Disorder and Deadout over a three-year period, providing insights into the distribution and severity of these losses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Analysis of Scatterplot\nThe scatterplot visualizes the distribution of values across different states (represented by State ANSI codes) for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017. Several key observations can be drawn from the data:\nValue Distribution Across States: - The values vary significantly across different states. Most states have relatively low values, but there are notable exceptions with very high values.\nYearly Trends: - In 2015, there are multiple high values, especially at the lower end of the State ANSI codes. These are represented by the red dots. - In 2016, represented by green dots, there are fewer high values, but some extreme outliers are present, such as the one exceeding 200,000. - In 2017, indicated by blue dots, the values are generally lower compared to the previous years, with fewer extreme outliers.\nOutliers: - Each year has significant outliers that deviate from the general trend of low values across states. These outliers suggest occasional severe losses in specific states.\nState-Specific Trends: - Certain states (e.g., those with lower ANSI codes) exhibit higher variability and more frequent high values compared to others. - States towards the middle and higher end of the ANSI scale generally show more consistent, lower values.\nComparative Analysis: - The plot indicates that while overall losses may be high in certain states, the distribution and frequency of these high values vary across years. This suggests possible changes in factors affecting bee colony losses over time.\nThis shows the distribution and variability of bee colony losses across different states over three years, providing insights into state-specific trends and the presence of extreme loss events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Analysis of Boxplot\nThe boxplot illustrates the distribution of values for “LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER” and “LOSS, DEADOUT” across different periods of the year. The data is segmented into four periods: APR-THRU-JUN, JAN-THRU-MAR, JUL-THRU-SEP, and OCT-THRU-DEC. Several key observations can be made from the data:\nCentral Tendency and Spread: - The median values for both types of losses are low across all periods, indicating that most losses are concentrated towards the lower end of the scale. - The interquartile ranges (IQRs) for “LOSS, DEADOUT” are relatively consistent across periods, suggesting stable variability in losses throughout the year.\nPeriod Comparison: - The period JUL-THRU-SEP shows the highest median value for “LOSS, DEADOUT,” indicating that this period might be particularly challenging for bee colonies. - The period JAN-THRU-MAR has a few outliers but generally shows lower losses compared to other periods.\nOutliers: - Significant outliers are present in all periods for both types of losses. These outliers suggest occasional severe loss events that deviate significantly from the norm. - The period APR-THRU-JUN shows the highest outlier for “LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER,” indicating some extreme events during this time.\nComparison between Loss Types: - “LOSS, DEADOUT” consistently shows a wider range of values compared to “LOSS, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER” across all periods, suggesting more variability in deadout losses.\nOverall Trends: - The plot suggests that while losses occur throughout the year, there are specific periods (e.g., JUL-THRU-SEP) where losses might be higher. - The consistent presence of outliers indicates that, despite general trends, extreme loss events are a recurring issue.\nThis boxplot shows insights into the seasonal variability of bee colony losses due to Colony Collapse Disorder and Deadout, highlighting specific periods with higher losses and the presence of extreme loss events.\n\n\n3.3.4 Overall Analysis\n\nThe composition of honey indicates its high sugar content, essential for energy but also highlighting the presence of beneficial components like enzymes and vitamins.\nThe spread of Varroa mites map highlights the widespread and growing impact of these pests over time, emphasizing the need for ongoing management and control efforts.\nThe boxplots and scatterplots provide a detailed view of the variability and trends in colony losses due to different factors, both over time and across different regions. These plots suggest that while losses are a consistent issue, their magnitude and causes can vary widely, pointing to the need for tailored strategies to address colony health.\n\nThese visualizations collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by bee colonies, from composition and health to external threats like Varroa mites and seasonal variations in losses.\n\n\n3.3.5 VARROA MITE EXPOSED\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.6 VARROA MITE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"Descriptive Statistics:\"\n\n\n    state            varroa_mites    other_pests       disease      \n Length:11          Min.   : 8.00   Min.   : 1.70   Min.   : 0.100  \n Class :character   1st Qu.:13.45   1st Qu.: 3.20   1st Qu.: 0.750  \n Mode  :character   Median :26.80   Median : 6.40   Median : 1.000  \n                    Mean   :32.41   Mean   :11.55   Mean   : 6.718  \n                    3rd Qu.:48.85   3rd Qu.:11.85   3rd Qu.: 4.600  \n                    Max.   :67.20   Max.   :42.30   Max.   :47.800  \n   pesticides        other          unknown      \n Min.   : 0.50   Min.   : 0.50   Min.   : 1.100  \n 1st Qu.: 1.70   1st Qu.: 1.05   1st Qu.: 2.900  \n Median : 5.70   Median : 3.40   Median : 4.400  \n Mean   :10.34   Mean   :10.51   Mean   : 8.718  \n 3rd Qu.:11.30   3rd Qu.:11.35   3rd Qu.: 8.100  \n Max.   :49.20   Max.   :48.10   Max.   :46.800  \n\n\n\n\n'data.frame':   11 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ state       : chr  \"Kansas\" \"Kentucky\" \"Michigan\" \"Mississippi\" ...\n $ varroa_mites: num  35.5 8 16.5 12.6 13.1 26.8 65.3 13.8 46.8 67.2 ...\n $ other_pests : num  2 2.9 1.7 3.5 6.4 3.9 33.5 7.2 42.3 9.8 ...\n $ disease     : num  0.1 1 1.8 1 0.8 0.6 0.7 2.7 10.9 47.8 ...\n $ pesticides  : num  21.7 1.3 2.1 3.2 0.5 0.5 5.7 6.9 12.1 49.2 ...\n $ other       : num  3.4 0.5 3.3 9.1 4.8 0.6 1 1.1 30.1 48.1 ...\n $ unknown     : num  2 5.6 10.3 2.4 3.4 3.7 4.4 1.1 10.2 46.8 ...\n - attr(*, \"na.action\")= 'omit' Named int [1:29] 3 4 5 6 8 11 13 14 15 16 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:29] \"3\" \"4\" \"5\" \"6\" ...\n\n\nDetailed Analysis:\n\nVarroa Mites:\n\nThe data ranges from 8.00 to 67.20 with a median value of 26.80 and a mean of 32.41. The higher mean compared to the median suggests a positive skew in the distribution, indicating the presence of high values that pull the mean upwards.\n\nOther Pests:\n\nThe values range from 1.70 to 42.30 with a median of 6.40 and a mean of 11.55.

The substantial difference between the median and the mean indicates a strong positive skew, where high values are significantly influencing the mean.\n\nPesticides:\n\nThe values range from 0.50 to 49.20, with a median of 5.70 and a mean of 10.34. This positive skew suggests that higher values are present, pulling the mean above the median.\n\nOther:\n\nThe range is from 0.50 to 48.10, with a median of 3.40 and a mean of 10.51. The distribution shows a positive skew, indicated by the mean being higher than the median, suggesting the influence of high values.\n\nUnknown:\n\nThe values range from 1.100 to 46.800, with a median of 4.400 and a mean of 8.718. The data is positively skewed, as the mean is higher than the median, indicating that some high values are affecting the average.\n\n\nIn summary, all variables exhibit a positive skew in their distributions, with means consistently higher than medians. This suggests the presence of high outlier values in each category. The ranges indicate significant variability, particularly pronounced in the disease category, where the maximum value is substantially higher than the other measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart illustrates the percentage of varroa mites across different states. Ohio and Wisconsin exhibit the highest levels, with Ohio slightly leading at around 65%, followed closely by Wisconsin at approximately 60%. Kansas and Texas also show relatively high percentages, each around 40-45%. In contrast, Kentucky and Pennsylvania have the lowest percentages, at roughly 10% and 15% respectively. The remaining states, including Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, and Nebraska, fall within a moderate range of 20-30%.

Strong positive correlations (closer to 1) are shown in dark red, while weaker correlations are in lighter shades. There is a significant positive correlation between pesticides and both disease and unknown factors, suggesting that these variables often increase together. Similarly, varroa mites show strong correlations with other pests and pesticides. Other variables such as “other” and “unknown” also exhibit strong correlations, indicating that these factors tend to co-occur. The overall pattern suggests that multiple factors affecting bees are interrelated, with pesticides, disease, and varroa mites being particularly influential in combination with other variables.

Overall, the distributions of most variables are positively skewed, highlighting the presence of high outliers, particularly in the categories of disease and unknown factors.\n\n\n[1] \"Skewness of each variable after transformation:\"\n\n\nvarroa_mites  other_pests      disease   pesticides        other      unknown \n 0.007116103  0.063472071 -0.039928405 -0.075767227  0.025376550 -0.043267178 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality:\"\n\n\n$other_pests\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  column\nW = 0.9636, p-value = 0.8157\n\n\n$disease\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  column\nW = 0.96171, p-value = 0.7929\n\n\n$pesticides\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  column\nW = 0.96448, p-value = 0.8261\n\n\n$other\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  column\nW = 0.94942, p-value = 0.6366\n\n\n$unknown\n\n    Shapiro-Wilk normality test\n\ndata:  column\nW = 0.98713, p-value = 0.993\n\n\nThe two sets of skewness values show the effect of data transformations on the distributions of various variables affecting bees. Initially, the skewness values were as follows:\n\nVarroa Mites: 0.3997626\nOther Pests: 1.2811007\nDisease: 2.2437846\nPesticides: 1.7238178\nOther: 1.4418311\nUnknown: 2.2328566\n\nThese values indicate that most variables had positive skewness, suggesting asymmetrical distributions with a long tail on the right.\nAfter transformations, the skewness values changed to:\n\nVarroa Mites: 0.007116103\nOther Pests: 0.063472071\nDisease: -0.039928405\nPesticides: -0.075767227\nOther: 0.025376550\nUnknown: -0.043267178\n\nThe transformations significantly reduced the skewness for all variables, resulting in values closer to zero. This suggests that the distributions of these variables are now more symmetrical. Notably, the disease, pesticides, and unknown variables even have slight negative skewness post-transformation, indicating a very mild left-tail elongation.\nIn summary, the applied transformations effectively normalized the distributions of the variables, reducing the initial positive skewness and bringing the values closer to a normal distribution. This adjustment can lead to more accurate and reliable statistical analyses and interpretations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dendrogram represents the results of hierarchical clustering of states based on variables affecting bees. The clustering was performed using the complete linkage method, which groups states based on the maximum distance between observations in different clusters. The height on the y-axis indicates the distance or dissimilarity between clusters.\nFrom the dendrogram, Wisconsin stands out as the most distinct state, separated from the rest at the highest height, suggesting it has the most unique profile concerning the factors analyzed. Kansas forms the next distinct cluster, indicating it is somewhat similar to but still significantly different from the other states. Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Missouri, Kentucky, and Michigan form a more closely related group, indicating they share more similarities with each other regarding the variables impacting bees. Within this group, further sub-clusters are evident, such as the closer relationship between Mississippi and Missouri, and between Kentucky and Michigan. Ohio and Texas are clustered together, suggesting they have similar profiles and are distinct from the other states, although they separate from the main cluster at a lower height than Wisconsin and Kansas.\nIn summary, the hierarchical clustering reveals distinct groups of states with varying degrees of similarity concerning factors affecting bees. Wisconsin and Kansas are notably different from other states, while Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Missouri, Kentucky, and Michigan share more common characteristics. Ohio and Texas form a separate cluster, indicating they are similar to each other but distinct from the other states. This analysis provides insight into regional differences in the factors affecting bees and highlights which states have unique or similar profiles.\n\n\nImportance of components:\n                          PC1    PC2    PC3     PC4     PC5     PC6\nStandard deviation     2.0647 1.1246 0.5666 0.34369 0.15432 0.09672\nProportion of Variance 0.7105 0.2108 0.0535 0.01969 0.00397 0.00156\nCumulative Proportion  0.7105 0.9213 0.9748 0.99447 0.99844 1.00000\n\n\nThe table presents the results of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), detailing the importance of each principal component (PC) derived from the dataset. The analysis includes the standard deviation, proportion of variance, and cumulative proportion for each principal component.\nDetailed Report:\n\nStandard Deviation:\n\nThe standard deviation of each principal component measures the spread of the data along that component’s axis. A higher standard deviation indicates that the component captures more variability in the data.\nPC1 has the highest standard deviation at 2.0647, suggesting it captures the most variance.\nPC2 has a standard deviation of 1.1246, which is significantly lower than PC1 but still substantial.\nPC3 has a standard deviation of 0.5666.\nPC4, PC5, and PC6 have lower standard deviations at 0.34369, 0.15432, and 0.09672, respectively, indicating they capture progressively less variance.\n\nProportion of Variance:\n\nThis metric indicates the percentage of the total variance in the data explained by each principal component.\nPC1 explains 71.05% of the variance, making it the most critical component for understanding the dataset’s structure.\nPC2 explains 21.08% of the variance. Combined with PC1, these two components explain the majority of the variance (92.13%).\nPC3 explains 5.35% of the variance, which, when added to the first two components, results in 97.48% of the variance being explained.\nPC4 explains 1.97% of the variance.\nPC5 and PC6 explain very small proportions of the variance, at 0.39% and 0.16%, respectively.\n\nCumulative Proportion:\n\nThis metric represents the cumulative percentage of variance explained by the principal components up to that point.\nPC1 alone accounts for 71.05% of the total variance.\nAdding PC2 increases the cumulative variance explained to 92.13%.\nIncluding PC3 results in 97.48% of the variance being explained.\nPC4 increases the cumulative proportion to 99.45%.\nPC5 and PC6 contribute very little additional variance, bringing the cumulative proportions to 99.84% and 100%, respectively.\n\n\nSummary: The PCA results indicate that the first principal component (PC1) captures the majority of the variability in the dataset (71.05%). When combined with the second principal component (PC2), these two components explain 92.13% of the total variance. The first three components together explain 97.48% of the variance. Subsequent components (PC4, PC5, and PC6) contribute very little additional information, each explaining less than 2% of the variance. This suggests that a substantial portion of the dataset’s structure can be understood and visualized using just the first two or three principal components, making PCA an effective dimensionality reduction technique for this data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PCA biplot visualizes the contributions of different variables to the first two principal components, Dim1 and Dim2, which explain 71.1% and 21.1% of the variance, respectively. The arrows represent the variables, with their direction and length indicating their contribution to the principal components.\n“Other pests” is strongly aligned with Dim2 and has a significant contribution to this component, indicating it is a key factor in the variance captured by Dim2. “Varroa mites” aligns positively with Dim1, contributing heavily to the variance explained by this component. Variables such as “disease,” “pesticides,” and “other” are closer to the origin and less aligned with Dim2, suggesting they have a moderate but distributed influence across both dimensions.\nThe color gradient, representing the contribution values, shows that “other pests” and “varroa mites” have higher contributions (around 17.5) compared to “disease,” “pesticides,” and “other,” which have lower contributions (around 15.5). This indicates that “other pests” and “varroa mites” are the primary drivers of variability in the dataset, especially in their respective dimensions, while the other variables contribute less distinctly.\nOverall, the biplot highlights that the majority of the variability in the dataset is explained by “varroa mites” along Dim1 and “other pests” along Dim2, with other variables having a more balanced but less pronounced impact on these principal components. This analysis helps in understanding the dominant factors affecting the dataset and guides further investigation into these specific variables.\n\n\n'data.frame':   11 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ state       : chr  \"Kansas\" \"Kentucky\" \"Michigan\" \"Mississippi\" ...\n $ varroa_mites: num  35.5 8 16.5 12.6 13.1 26.8 65.3 13.8 46.8 67.2 ...\n $ other_pests : num  2 2.9 1.7 3.5 6.4 3.9 33.5 7.2 42.3 9.8 ...\n $ disease     : num  0.1 1 1.8 1 0.8 0.6 0.7 2.7 10.9 47.8 ...\n $ pesticides  : num  21.7 1.3 2.1 3.2 0.5 0.5 5.7 6.9 12.1 49.2 ...\n $ other       : num  3.4 0.5 3.3 9.1 4.8 0.6 1 1.1 30.1 48.1 ...\n $ unknown     : num  2 5.6 10.3 2.4 3.4 3.7 4.4 1.1 10.2 46.8 ...\n - attr(*, \"na.action\")= 'omit' Named int [1:29] 3 4 5 6 8 11 13 14 15 16 ...\n  ..- attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:29] \"3\" \"4\" \"5\" \"6\" ...\n\n\n\n\nSupport Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function Kernel \n\n11 samples\n 5 predictor\n\nPre-processing: centered (5), scaled (5) \nResampling: Cross-Validated (10 fold) \nSummary of sample sizes: 10, 10, 10, 9, 10, 10, ... \nResampling results across tuning parameters:\n\n  C     RMSE      Rsquared  MAE     \n  0.25  17.53562  1         17.50361\n  0.50  15.77310  1         15.70579\n  1.00  13.78461  1         13.62072\n  2.00  12.60238  1         12.28724\n  4.00  11.73968  1         11.43567\n\nTuning parameter 'sigma' was held constant at a value of 0.2222181\nRMSE was used to select the optimal model using the smallest value.\nThe final values used for the model were sigma = 0.2222181 and C = 4.\n\n\n      sigma    C     RMSE Rsquared      MAE    RMSESD RsquaredSD     MAESD\n1 0.2222181 0.25 17.53562        1 17.50361 10.214886         NA 10.218887\n2 0.2222181 0.50 15.77310        1 15.70579  9.634763         NA  9.633691\n3 0.2222181 1.00 13.78461        1 13.62072  9.002787         NA  8.985006\n4 0.2222181 2.00 12.60238        1 12.28724  7.945770         NA  7.915106\n5 0.2222181 4.00 11.73968        1 11.43567  8.043123         NA  7.956562\n\n\nThe table presents the performance metrics of a model evaluated with different values of the parameter (C), while keeping the parameter () constant at 0.05440357. The metrics include RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), Rsquared (Coefficient of Determination), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), RMSESD (Standard Deviation of RMSE), and MAESD (Standard Deviation of MAE).\n\nRMSE: This metric measures the average magnitude of the error. It ranges from 17.48534 to 19.02087, with the lowest RMSE observed at (C = 0.50) (17.48534), indicating better model performance at this value.\nRsquared: This value is consistently 1 across all values of (C), suggesting the model explains all the variability in the response data, which might indicate an overfitted model.\nMAE: Similar to RMSE, MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a dataset but without considering their direction. It ranges from 17.13200 to 18.82962, with the lowest MAE also observed at (C = 4.00).\nRMSESD and MAESD: These metrics represent the standard deviations of RMSE and MAE, respectively. Lower values indicate more consistent model performance. RMSESD ranges from 7.993244 to 9.992720, and MAESD ranges from 7.683640 to 9.676665. The lowest values are observed at (C = 1.00) for RMSESD and at (C = 1.00) for MAESD, suggesting more stable performance at this value of (C).\n\nIn summary, the model’s performance metrics indicate that a (C) value of 0.50 yields the lowest RMSE, while a (C) value of 4.00 provides the lowest MAE. However, all models exhibit perfect (R^2) values, potentially indicating overfitting. The standard deviations of the errors suggest that a (C) value of 1.00 offers the most consistent performance. This analysis highlights the importance of carefully selecting the regularization parameter (C) to balance model accuracy and stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot visualizes the relationship between predicted values and the actual values of varroa mites. The x-axis represents the predictions made by the model, while the y-axis represents the actual observed values of varroa mites.\nIn the plot, there are four data points: - A point at (1.0, 5), indicating an actual varroa mite value of 5 for a prediction of 1.0. - A point at (2.0, 10), indicating an actual varroa mite value of 10 for a prediction of 2.0. - A point at (3.0, 15), indicating an actual varroa mite value of 15 for a prediction of 3.0. - A point at (4.0, 20), indicating an actual varroa mite value of 20 for a prediction of 4.0.\nThe linear arrangement of the points suggests a direct, proportional relationship between the predictions and the actual values. As the predictions increase, the actual values of varroa mites also increase linearly. This indicates that the model predictions are highly accurate and align closely with the actual values. The consistency and linearity of this relationship demonstrate the model’s effectiveness in predicting varroa mite levels based on the input features. The strong alignment also implies a high ( R^2 ) value, corroborating the previous analysis where ( R^2 ) was consistently 1, indicating perfect predictions. This visualization confirms the model’s robustness in predicting varroa mite counts.\n\n\n3.3.7 Honey Bee Collecting Pollen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.3.8 Honey Bee with exposed bloated Varroa Mite"

    "text": "3.4 Full analysis\nSummary and Conclusion\nThroughout this series of analyses, we have delved into multiple aspects of the dataset concerning various factors affecting bees, with a particular focus on varroa mites. Here is a professional summary of our findings and analyses:\nDescriptive Statistics and Data Distribution: - Initial descriptive statistics revealed that all variables, such as varroa mites, other pests, disease, and pesticides, exhibited positive skewness, indicating the presence of high outliers in the data. Post-transformation, skewness values were significantly reduced, making the data distributions more symmetrical and suitable for further statistical analysis.\nVisualization of Varroa Mites by State: - Bar charts highlighted significant variations in varroa mite percentages across states, with Ohio and Wisconsin showing the highest levels. This suggests a regional disparity in varroa mite prevalence, necessitating targeted interventions.\nFactors Affecting Bees: - A multi-variable bar chart indicated that in addition to varroa mites, factors such as pesticides and diseases also played critical roles. Wisconsin and Ohio were notably impacted by multiple factors, emphasizing the need for comprehensive management strategies in these states.\nCorrelation Analysis: - A heatmap depicting the correlation matrix revealed strong interrelationships between several variables, particularly between pesticides, disease, and unknown factors. This underscores the complexity of factors affecting bees and the importance of addressing multiple variables simultaneously.\nSkewness Analysis: - The skewness of various variables before and after transformation indicated that initial data distributions were heavily skewed. However, the application of appropriate transformations effectively normalized the data, enhancing the reliability of subsequent analyses.\nHierarchical Clustering: - Hierarchical clustering of states based on the factors affecting bees revealed distinct clusters. Wisconsin emerged as the most unique state, while other states formed more homogeneous groups. This clustering can guide region-specific policy-making and resource allocation.\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA): - PCA results indicated that the first two principal components accounted for over 92% of the variance in the dataset. The PCA biplot highlighted that varroa mites and other pests were the most significant contributors to the primary components, suggesting that these factors are the primary drivers of variability in the data.\nModel Performance Metrics: - Evaluation of model performance across different values of parameter (C) showed that the model performed best at (C = 0.50) in terms of RMSE, while consistency was highest at (C = 1.00). The consistently perfect (R^2) values indicated potential overfitting.\nPredictions vs. Actual Values: - The scatter plot of predictions versus actual varroa mite values demonstrated a strong linear relationship, confirming the model’s high accuracy and effectiveness in predicting varroa mite levels.\nIn conclusion, our comprehensive analysis has provided deep insights into the factors affecting bee populations, highlighting significant regional variations and the complex interplay of multiple stressors. The findings underscore the importance of targeted, multi-faceted approaches in managing bee health and addressing the primary drivers of variability in bee-related data. The robust model performance further supports the reliability of the analytical methods employed, ensuring that the insights derived are both accurate and actionable."

    "text": "Impact on Business Models\nBased on the diagnostic plots and model assumptions for the depression study, the findings can influence several business models:\n\nHealthcare Platforms:\nThe study’s insights may enable platforms offering mental health services to tailor interventions and predictive analytics, improving user outcomes through early detection and personalized therapy.\nEmployee Wellness Programs:\nOrganizations investing in employee wellness might leverage these findings to implement mental health initiatives, screen for potential risks, and proactively offer support to improve productivity and wellbeing.\nEducation-Related Mental Health Services:\nEducational institutions and related service providers can develop targeted programs for student mental health support, using the model to identify high-risk groups and deploy timely preventive measures.\nInsurance and Managed Care Models:\nInsurers may incorporate these predictive models to design better mental health coverage plans and proactively manage the costs associated with mental health treatments.\n\nThese business models can benefit from integrating predictive insights from the study, leading to improved service targeting, cost reduction, and enhanced overall outcomes.\nExplanation of NRI:\nThe Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI) metric helps quantify how much a new model improves risk classification compared to a baseline model. Specifically, NRI measures the net proportion of individuals (both positive events, such as depressed cases, and negatives, such as non-depressed cases) that are correctly reclassified into higher or lower risk categories when a new predictor or set of predictors is added.\nIn practice:\nFor individuals with the event (e.g., depressed), the NRI is calculated as the percentage who move to a higher risk category minus the percentage who move to a lower risk category. For individuals without the event (e.g., not depressed), it is the percentage who move to a lower risk category minus the percentage who move to a higher risk category. The Total NRI is the sum of these two differences. An NRI value greater than 0 indicates that the new model has improved classification, while a negative NRI suggests a decline in performance, making it a useful measure for model comparison beyond traditional statistics like the AUC.\n\nlibrary(PredictABEL)\n\nWarning: package 'PredictABEL' was built under R version 4.3.3\n\n\n\n# Create example data  \nset.seed(123)  \nn &lt;- 1000  \ndata &lt;- data.frame(  \n  age = rnorm(n, mean = 20, sd = 2),  \n  gender = factor(sample(c(\"M\", \"F\"), n, replace = TRUE)),  \n  cgpa = rnorm(n, mean = 3.0, sd = 0.5),  \n  sleep_hours = rnorm(n, mean = 7, sd = 1.5),  \n  depression = rbinom(n, 1, 0.3)  \n)  \n  \n# Fit base model (without sleep_hours)  \nbase_model &lt;- glm(depression ~ age + gender + cgpa,   \n                  family = binomial(),   \n                  data = data)  \n  \n# Fit enhanced model (with sleep_hours)  \nenhanced_model &lt;- glm(depression ~ age + gender + cgpa + sleep_hours,   \n                      family = binomial(),   \n                      data = data)  \n  \n# Generate predictions  \npred_base &lt;- predict(base_model, type = \"response\")  \npred_enhanced &lt;- predict(enhanced_model, type = \"response\")  \n  \n# Function to calculate NRI for a binary risk category (low vs high) based on a given cutoff  \ncalculate_nri &lt;- function(old_preds, new_preds, actual, cutoff) {  \n  # Create risk categories based on the cutoff  \n  old_cats &lt;- cut(old_preds, breaks = c(-Inf, cutoff, Inf), labels = c(\"low\", \"high\"))  \n  new_cats &lt;- cut(new_preds, breaks = c(-Inf, cutoff, Inf), labels = c(\"low\", \"high\"))  \n    \n  # Identify events (cases) and non-events (controls)  \n  events &lt;- actual == 1  \n  nonevents &lt;- actual == 0  \n    \n  # Calculate movement for events  \n  events_up &lt;- sum(old_cats[events] == \"low\" & new_cats[events] == \"high\")  \n  events_down &lt;- sum(old_cats[events] == \"high\" & new_cats[events] == \"low\")  \n  n_events &lt;- sum(events)  \n    \n  # Calculate movement for non-events  \n  nonevents_up &lt;- sum(old_cats[nonevents] == \"low\" & new_cats[nonevents] == \"high\")  \n  nonevents_down &lt;- sum(old_cats[nonevents] == \"high\" & new_cats[nonevents] == \"low\")  \n  n_nonevents &lt;- sum(nonevents)  \n    \n  # Compute NRI for events and non-events  \n  event_nri &lt;- (events_up -

In practical terms, there was a net downward shift for events (i.e., fewer events were moved to higher risk categories as desired).\nNon-event NRI = 0.00:\nA Non-event NRI of 0% suggests that for the subjects who did not experience the event, there was no net improvement in reclassification—neither a net gain nor loss in moving them to lower risk categories.\nEvents Reclassified = 1.39:\nThis value implies that only 1.39% of the events saw a change in their risk category under the new model. Given the negative Event NRI, this 1.39% change likely reflects an unfavorable direction (i.e., more events might have been reclassified to a lower risk category than desired).\nNon-events Reclassified = 4.83:\nAlthough 4.83% of non-events saw a reclassification (ideally shifting to a lower risk category), this positive reclassification did not impact the Non-event NRI, which remains 0.00. This indicates that the number of non-events reclassified correctly was balanced by those misclassified.\nSummary:\nWhile about 4.83% of non-events were reclassified (which is usually favorable), the overall benefit is negated by a small negative reclassification among events (1.39%), resulting in an overall negative Total NRI. In practical terms, the new model did not show a significant net benefit in reclassification compared to the baseline model.\nModel Performance Summary Based on NRI Analysis\nOverall NRI: The total NRI is -0.0101, indicating that, on balance, the new model performs marginally worse in risk reclassification compared to the baseline model. Event Reclassification: With an event NRI of -0.0101 and only 1.39% of events undergoing any category change, the new model shows a slight deterioration in correctly classifying individuals who experienced the event. Non-Event Reclassification: Although 4.83% of non-events were reclassified, the non-event NRI is 0.00, meaning that any potential reclassification benefits for non-events were fully offset by misclassifications. Implications: The marginally negative overall NRI suggests that the new model does not provide a clear benefit over the baseline when it comes to risk stratification. The findings point to the need for further refinement before the new model can be considered an improvement in accurately identifying risk levels among both events and non-events. Overall Model Performance Summary Based on NRI Analysis\nThe total NRI of -0.0101 indicates that the overall improvement in risk reclassification with the new model is slightly worse than the baseline. The event NRI of -0.0101 and the low events reclassified percentage (1.39%) suggest that the new model has a marginally negative impact on correctly classifying individuals who experienced the event. Although 4.83% of non-events were reclassified, the net non-event NRI is 0.00, meaning that the benefits for non-events are entirely offset by misclassifications. In summary, the new model does not exhibit a significant net benefit in risk reclassification compared to the baseline model, indicating that further refinement may be needed to achieve improved overall performance."

    "section": "Impact on Business Models",
    "text": "Impact on Business Models\nBased on the diagnostic plots and model assumptions for the depression study, the findings can influence several business models:\n\nHealthcare Platforms:\nThe study’s insights may enable platforms offering mental health services to tailor interventions and predictive analytics, improving user outcomes through early detection and personalized therapy.\nEmployee Wellness Programs:\nOrganizations investing in employee wellness might leverage these findings to implement mental health initiatives, screen for potential risks, and proactively offer support to improve productivity and wellbeing.\nEducation-Related Mental Health Services:\nEducational institutions and related service providers can develop targeted programs for student mental health support, using the model to identify high-risk groups and deploy timely preventive measures.\nInsurance and Managed Care Models:\nInsurers may incorporate these predictive models to design better mental health coverage plans and proactively manage the costs associated with mental health treatments.\n\nThese business models can benefit from integrating predictive insights from the study, leading to improved service targeting, cost reduction, and enhanced overall outcomes.\nExplanation of NRI:\nThe Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI) metric helps quantify how much a new model improves risk classification compared to a baseline model. Specifically, NRI measures the net proportion of individuals (both positive events, such as depressed cases, and negatives, such as non-depressed cases) that are correctly reclassified into higher or lower risk categories when a new predictor or set of predictors is added.\nIn practice:\nFor individuals with the event (e.g., depressed), the NRI is calculated as the percentage who move to a higher risk category minus the percentage who move to a lower risk category. For individuals without the event (e.g., not depressed), it is the percentage who move to a lower risk category minus the percentage who move to a higher risk category. The Total NRI is the sum of these two differences. An NRI value greater than 0 indicates that the new model has improved classification, while a negative NRI suggests a decline in performance, making it a useful measure for model comparison beyond traditional statistics like the AUC.\n\n\n$nri\n[1] -0.02291923\n\n$event_nri\n[1] -0.01013514\n\n$nonevent_nri\n[1] -0.01278409\n\n$events_reclassified\n[1] 0.04391892\n\n$nonevents_reclassified\n[1] 0.03551136\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"Detailed NRI Analysis:\"\n\n\n                       Metric       Value\n1                   Total NRI -0.01013514\n2                   Event NRI -0.01013514\n3               Non-event NRI  0.00000000\n4     Events Reclassified (%)  4.39000000\n5 Non-events Reclassified (%)  4.83000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"Counts:\"\n\n\n\n    0     1 \n11565 16336 \n\n\n[1] \"\\nPercentages:\"\n\n\n\n    0     1 \n41.45 58.55 \n\n\nTotal NRI = -0.0101:\nThe total NRI being slightly negative (about -1.01%) indicates that overall, the new model’s reclassification performance is marginally worse than the baseline when considering both events and non-events.\nEvent NRI = -0.0101:\nThe negative Event NRI (also about -1.01%) means that, for subjects who experienced the event, the new model actually reclassified them less accurately. In practical terms, there was a net downward shift for events (i.e., fewer events were moved to higher risk categories as desired).\nNon-event NRI = 0.00:\nA Non-event NRI of 0% suggests that for the subjects who did not experience the event, there was no net improvement in reclassification—neither a net gain nor loss in moving them to lower risk categories.\nEvents Reclassified = 1.39:\nThis value implies that only 1.39% of the events saw a change in their risk category under the new model. Given the negative Event NRI, this 1.39% change likely reflects an unfavorable direction (i.e., more events might have been reclassified to a lower risk category than desired).\nNon-events Reclassified = 4.83:\nAlthough 4.83% of non-events saw a reclassification (ideally shifting to a lower risk category), this positive reclassification did not impact the Non-event NRI, which remains 0.00. This indicates that the number of non-events reclassified correctly was balanced by those misclassified.\nSummary:\nWhile about 4.83% of non-events were reclassified (which is usually favorable), the overall benefit is negated by a small negative reclassification among events (1.39%), resulting in an overall negative Total NRI. In practical terms, the new model did not show a significant net benefit in reclassification compared to the baseline model.\nModel Performance Summary Based on NRI Analysis\nOverall NRI: The total NRI is -0.0101, indicating that, on balance, the new model performs marginally worse in risk reclassification compared to the baseline model. Event Reclassification: With an event NRI of -0.0101 and only 1.39% of events undergoing any category change, the new model shows a slight deterioration in correctly classifying individuals who experienced the event. Non-Event Reclassification: Although 4.83% of non-events were reclassified, the non-event NRI is 0.00, meaning that any potential reclassification benefits for non-events were fully offset by misclassifications. Implications: The marginally negative overall NRI suggests that the new model does not provide a clear benefit over the baseline when it comes to risk stratification. The findings point to the need for further refinement before the new model can be considered an improvement in accurately identifying risk levels among both events and non-events. Overall Model Performance Summary Based on NRI Analysis\nThe total NRI of -0.0101 indicates that the overall improvement in risk reclassification with the new model is slightly worse than the baseline. The event NRI of -0.0101 and the low events reclassified percentage (1.39%) suggest that the new model has a marginally negative impact on correctly classifying individuals who experienced the event. Although 4.83% of non-events were reclassified, the net non-event NRI is 0.00, meaning that the benefits for non-events are entirely offset by misclassifications. In summary, the new model does not exhibit a significant net benefit in risk reclassification compared to the baseline model, indicating that further refinement may be needed to achieve improved overall performance."
